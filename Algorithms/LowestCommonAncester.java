//But keep in mind that if your nodes have parent pointers, a slight variation on his algorithm is possible. For both nodes in question construct a list containing the path from root to the node by starting at the node, and front inserting the parent.

// basically, it could be O(n), but can be optimized to O(logn) and space O(logn) if it is BST. Because for general binary tree, you cannnot traverse to find the node in O(logn)

//http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lowest-common-ancestor-binary-tree-set-1/

//(iterative way O(n) and O(logn))
//Find the given node Node1 in the tree using binary search and save all nodes visited in this process in an array say A1. Time - O(logn), Space - O(logn)
//Find the given Node2 in the tree using binary search and save all nodes visited in this process in an array say A2. Time - O(logn), Space - O(logn)
//If A1 list or A2 list is empty then one the node does not exist so there is no common ancestor.
//If A1 list and A2 list are non-empty then look into the list until you find non-matching node. As soon as you find such a node then node prior to that is common ancestor.

//recursion way, O(n) and O(logn) space, Note that the above method assumes that keys are present in Binary Tree. If one key is present and other is absent, then it returns the present key as LCA (Ideally should have returned NULL).

//Consider a scenario where n2 is deeper in the subtree where node n1 is the root. In that case findLCAUtil will return with v1 as true and v2 as false and the node *lca would be node with value as n1. We need find(lca, n2 ) to be sure if node n2 is actually there. I hope this makes it clear.
