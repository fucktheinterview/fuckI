//Question: Given two numbers. Write a algorithm to select the larger one without using comparison operator and if sentence.
//Solution: Using bit manipulate. We first calculate the results of substracting one number from another. Then we judge if this 
//result is a positive number or a negative number. We should notice that when computer store a signed number, it will use
//the first bit to indicate the sign of the number (0 means positive and 1 means negative).

	temp = (temp>>31) & 0x1;
	cout<<temp<<endl;
	cout << a+temp*(b-a)<<endl;
